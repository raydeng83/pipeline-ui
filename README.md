# PingHub

A web UI for managing Ping Advanced Identity Cloud (AIC) tenant configurations — pull config from a tenant, push it back, and promote it across environments (dev → staging → prod) with a guided diff-review workflow.

Built on top of a vendored subset of [`fr-config-manager`](https://github.com/ForgeRock/fr-config-manager) so teams can drive the pull/push/promote lifecycle from a browser instead of the CLI.

## Features

- **Pull** — stream live CLI output while fetching config for any scope (journeys, scripts, IDM managed objects, endpoints, IGA applications/entitlements, SAML, CSP, themes, and more — 40+ scopes).
- **Push** — apply local config back to a tenant, with a production-only confirmation step.
- **Promote** — multi-phase workflow: lock → dry-run diff → review → promote → verify → unlock, with rollback.
- **Journey viewer** — browse journeys as an interactive ReactFlow graph, outline, table, swim-lane, or raw JSON. Inline node details, script overlay, search, trace upstream/downstream/data paths, fold passthrough chains, ELK or dagre layouts.
- **Semantic journey diff** — compare journeys across environments with a canvas that highlights added / removed / modified / unchanged nodes, side-by-side script diffs, and inner-tree navigation.
- **Environments manager** — add tenants through a guided wizard; raw `.env` editor and tenant connection test.
- **Search / analyze** — global search across scopes, "find usage" for scripts, endpoints, and inner journeys.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+ (project uses Next.js 16 / React 19).
- npm (lock file is `package-lock.json`).
- Access to one or more Ping AIC tenants and a service account with the scopes you want to manage.
- A local working directory for each tenant's config files (the `CONFIG_DIR` referenced below).

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bostonidentity/PingHub.git
cd PingHub
npm install
```

## Configure tenants

Each tenant is described by:

1. An entry in `environments/environments.json`:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "name": "dev",
       "label": "Development",
       "color": "#22c55e",
       "envFile": "dev.env"
     }
   ]
   ```
2. A matching `.env` file in `environments/` (gitignored by default). Minimum fields:
   ```
   TENANT_BASE_URL=https://openam-<tenant>.forgeblocks.com
   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=<uuid>
   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"kty":"RSA",...}   # JWK, single line
   CONFIG_DIR=/absolute/path/to/tenant-config
   REALMS=alpha
   SCRIPT_PREFIXES=MyPrefix_
   ```
   Optional fields cover agents, SAML, policies, managed objects, raw endpoints, CSP, and more — see `src/lib/env-parser.ts` for the full list.

The environments wizard in the UI will create/edit these files for you — the above is mainly useful if you're bootstrapping from the command line.

> `.env*` and `environments/` are gitignored. Keep service-account keys out of any public fork.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev        # development at http://localhost:3000

npm run start      # production server
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test           # one-shot (vitest)
npm run test:watch # watch mode
```
